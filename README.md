# Project Structure

## _project_starter_

The base of each lesson, example 01-expanding-cards, are based off of the templates in the _project_starter_ folder for JavaScript and React. In a future state this will include Angular, Svelte, Vue and others.

## _project_starter_/express

Some examples in the repository use services to fetch data. The Express template is there for that purpose

## _project_starter_/javascript

Template used for each lesson using plain JavaScript

## _project_starter_/javascript

Template used for each lesson using React which includes an example service for getting information from the Express application. For examples that do not require a backend interaction, the code found in `/src/interface` can be removed and the code in `components/Lesson.tsx` can be deleted as well.
